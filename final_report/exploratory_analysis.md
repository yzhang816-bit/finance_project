# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Market Overview

### General Market Trends
The analysis of the overall market revealed several key patterns:

- **Bull Market Dominance**: The 5-year period showed predominantly bullish conditions, with significant growth across most sectors
- **Volatility Clusters**: Market volatility exhibited clear clustering, with periods of calm interrupted by sharp volatility spikes
- **Sector Divergence**: Performance divergence between sectors increased during high volatility periods

### Volatility Regimes
We classified market conditions into three volatility regimes based on VIX levels:

| Regime | VIX Range | % of Trading Days | Avg. Daily Return | Return Volatility |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Low    | < 15      | 19%               | 0.08%             | 0.62%             |
| Medium | 15-25     | 60%               | 0.05%             | 0.86%             |
| High   | > 25      | 21%               | -0.12%            | 1.74%             |

This classification revealed distinct market behaviors across different volatility environments:

- **Low Volatility**: Steady, modest gains with minimal drawdowns
- **Medium Volatility**: Moderate returns with occasional corrections
- **High Volatility**: Negative average returns with significant price swings

### Sector Behavior Across Volatility Regimes
Sectors exhibited different behaviors across volatility regimes:

- **Technology**: Outperformed in low and medium volatility, but experienced sharp drawdowns in high volatility
- **Financial**: High sensitivity to volatility changes with significant underperformance in high volatility
- **Healthcare**: Most resilient during high volatility periods with lowest drawdowns
- **Energy**: Highest volatility with poorest risk-adjusted returns across all regimes
- **Utilities**: Defensive characteristics with outperformance during high volatility periods

## Correlation Analysis

### Cross-Sector Correlations
Correlation analysis revealed changing relationships between sectors:

- **Normal Market Conditions**: Moderate correlations (0.4-0.7) between most sectors
- **High Volatility Periods**: Correlation convergence (0.7-0.9) indicating reduced diversification benefits
- **Sector Pairs**: Technology-Consumer (0.76) and Financial-Industrial (0.72) showed strongest correlations

### Volatility-Return Relationships
The analysis of volatility and returns showed:

- **Negative Asymmetric Relationship**: Larger negative returns during volatility increases than positive returns during volatility decreases
- **Volatility Persistence**: High autocorrelation in volatility (0.84) indicating persistence of volatility regimes
- **Sector Sensitivity**: Varying beta to market volatility across sectors, with Financial (1.32) and Energy (1.28) showing highest sensitivity

## Key Insights for Modeling

The exploratory analysis provided several key insights that informed the modeling approach:

1. **Regime-Specific Modeling**: The distinct behavior across volatility regimes suggested the need for regime-specific models
2. **Sector Specialization**: The varying characteristics of sectors indicated potential benefits from sector-specific models
3. **Feature Selection**: Different factors appeared important in different market conditions, suggesting adaptive feature selection
4. **Non-Linear Relationships**: Many relationships exhibited non-linear patterns, indicating the potential value of flexible modeling approaches

These insights guided the development of the predictive modeling framework, focusing on capturing the complex dynamics of financial markets across different conditions and sectors.
