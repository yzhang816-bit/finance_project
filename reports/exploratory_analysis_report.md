# Exploratory Data Analysis: Impact of Market Volatility on Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This report presents the findings from our exploratory analysis of how market volatility affects the accuracy of stock price prediction models across different market sectors. We analyzed historical stock price data, volatility measurements, and economic indicators to identify patterns and relationships that could inform more effective prediction strategies.

## Key Findings

### Volatility Patterns

Our analysis identified distinct volatility regimes based on the VIX index:
- Low volatility (VIX < 15): 237 days
- Medium volatility (15 ≤ VIX < 25): 751 days
- High volatility (VIX ≥ 25): 266 days

Market performance varies significantly across these regimes:
- Low volatility periods show annualized returns of 0.38% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.13
- Medium volatility periods show annualized returns of 0.29% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.08
- High volatility periods show annualized returns of -0.22% with a Sharpe ratio of -0.06

### Sector-Specific Responses

Different sectors show varying responses to volatility:
- Technology performs best in low volatility environments with 0.75% annualized returns if best_sector_low != "N/A" else "N/A"
- Utilities shows the most resilience during high volatility with -0.07% annualized returns if best_sector_high != "N/A" else "N/A"
- Technology is most negatively impacted by high volatility with -0.85% annualized returns if worst_sector_high != "N/A" else "N/A"

Sector correlations also change significantly across volatility regimes, with higher correlations generally observed during high volatility periods, reducing diversification benefits.

### Prediction Accuracy

Our simple momentum-based prediction model shows varying accuracy across volatility regimes:
- Low volatility: 51.32% directional accuracy if 'low' in accuracy.columns else "N/A"
- Medium volatility: 49.85% directional accuracy if 'medium' in accuracy.columns else "N/A"
- High volatility: 49.58% directional accuracy if 'high' in accuracy.columns else "N/A"

This suggests that prediction models need to be adjusted based on the prevailing volatility regime to maintain reliability.

Sector-specific prediction accuracy also varies, with Industrial showing the most predictable behavior during high volatility periods (50.72% accuracy if best_sector_pred != "N/A" else "N/A").

### Feature Importance

Our analysis identified several features that correlate with prediction accuracy:
- VIX_change shows the strongest correlation (0.064 if top_feature != "N/A" else "N/A") with prediction accuracy
- VIX level itself has a correlation of -0.04874623717011144 with prediction accuracy
- Market volatility has a correlation of -0.014254517913127445 with prediction accuracy

These findings suggest that incorporating volatility metrics into prediction models could improve their performance across different market conditions.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

Our exploratory analysis reveals that market volatility significantly impacts the accuracy of stock price prediction models, with effects varying across different market sectors. Key conclusions include:

1. Prediction models perform differently across volatility regimes, suggesting the need for regime-specific approaches
2. Sector responses to volatility vary considerably, with some sectors showing more resilience than others
3. Incorporating volatility metrics as features could improve prediction model performance

Based on these findings, we recommend:

1. Developing volatility regime-aware prediction models that can adapt to changing market conditions
2. Creating sector-specific models that account for the unique characteristics of each sector
3. Incorporating VIX and other volatility metrics as key features in prediction models
4. Exploring more sophisticated models that can capture the non-linear relationships between volatility and price movements

The next phase of this project will focus on implementing and testing these recommendations through the development of adaptive prediction models.
