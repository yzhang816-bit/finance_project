# Project Todo List

## Data Collection and Preparation
- [ ] Download historical stock data for multiple sectors using Yahoo Finance API
- [ ] Obtain VIX data for market volatility measurements
- [ ] Collect economic indicators from FRED
- [ ] Clean and preprocess the collected data
- [ ] Handle missing values and outliers
- [ ] Create a unified dataset with all relevant features

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- [ ] Analyze volatility patterns across different time periods
- [ ] Examine correlations between volatility and stock price movements
- [ ] Identify sector-specific responses to volatility
- [ ] Create visualizations to illustrate key relationships
- [ ] Document initial findings and insights

## Feature Engineering
- [ ] Create volatility regime indicators
- [ ] Develop technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.)
- [ ] Generate sector-specific features
- [ ] Prepare features for modeling

## Model Development
- [ ] Implement baseline prediction models
- [ ] Train models on different volatility regimes
- [ ] Evaluate model performance across sectors
- [ ] Refine models based on initial results
- [ ] Develop a meta-model for prediction strategy selection

## Report Preparation
- [ ] Prepare Part A report (Question Formation and Exploratory Analysis)
- [ ] Prepare Part B report (Big Data Analysis)
- [ ] Prepare Part C report (Modeling)
- [ ] Prepare Part D report (Final Report)
- [ ] Ensure all reports meet assignment requirements

## Project Validation
- [ ] Validate all analyses against project requirements
- [ ] Ensure all visualizations are clear and informative
- [ ] Check that all code is well-documented and reproducible
- [ ] Verify that all reports follow the required format and referencing style
